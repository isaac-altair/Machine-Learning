It performs a bit better than the linear regression (the value of RMSE is 68628.413493824875). One of the reasons why the performance of Lasso Regression may be similar to that of Linear Regression is that for the small values of alpha the Lasso Regression resembles the Regression Regression due to the penalty (alpha * L1 norm of the weights) being small. Therefore, Lasso Regression fits training data better than the Linear Regression. On the other hand, when it comes to the test set, Lasso Regression has an RMSE of 66808.43524898415 as compared to 48209.6 of the Linear Regression. Therefore, Lasso Regression underfits the the test data as compared to the Linear Regression. It seems that the penalty f-n has a greater negative effect on the test data. From my understanding, this is due to the effect of 'sparsity' - as we increase the value of alpha, the amount of features with the zero coefficient increases thus leading to the underfitting.</pre>"
